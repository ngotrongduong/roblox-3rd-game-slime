## 2026-10-27 — project started

Done
- The original web game (makeplay.ai, "Goo Lineage V2") was read in full: its JS source, its
  `AGENTS.md`, 600+ art, sound and animation files (`reference/goo-lineage-web/`, gitignored),
  and all 514 messages the owner sent its AI builder.
- Reference specs written: `docs/reference/01`–`05` (farm, battle, UI and world, effects, the
  owner's history of requests and vetoes).
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: what the Roblox version keeps and changes, and the build order.
- Project skeleton: Rojo tree, Lune tests, StyLua, Selene, `tools/check.ps1` (CHECK OK).

Decided by the owner
- The look (`docs/DESIGN.md` §3): full 3D cartoon in the style of their art. Start Phase 1.

## 2026-10-27 — Phase 1, Foundation: done (logic and tests; not yet run in Studio)

Done
- Farm rules in `src/shared` (pure Luau, run in Lune and Roblox): `Rng` (mulberry32, matches the
  JS), `Colours`, `DualDesigns` (20), `SecretRecipes` (66), `Stats`, `Genetics` (colour + pattern
  genes), `Luck`, `Growth`, `Mutations`, `Breeding` (eligibility, timers, stat inheritance, eggs,
  pity, tutorial first egg), `Hatching` (idempotent), `FarmState` (types, `newFarm`, field-by-field
  `repair`). Times are server seconds.
- Player profiles: `ProfileLogic` (envelope, session lock, migrations, last-good copy, size
  budget), server `ProfileStore` (UpdateAsync lock, retries, budget, BindToClose) and `PlayerData`
  (get / update / markKeyMoment; autosave every 5 min when changed, key moments within 4 s).
  `FarmSave` plugs the farm in: a stored farm that cannot be read is never replaced by a fresh one.
- 136 Lune checks pass; `tools/types.ps1` TYPES OK.

Decisions taken while porting
- Starters are created already adult (the original left them babies for 3 s).
- Mutation rolls stay sequential like the original (secret 1%, dual 5%, base 10%), in one function
  (`Mutations.rollCategory`) so a single categorical roll can replace it later.
- Starting slots 20 (+5 a level, max 220), as in the original.

## 2026-10-27 — the map and the UI come first (owner)

The owner asked to redesign the map and the UI before Phase 2: one valley for 8 players, home
plots and a trading area on the rim, a flat Wild Garden in the middle with monster slimes and
fights (also between players' slimes), and six upgradable areas a plot (fishing, garden, kitchen,
pantry, training, breeding), each level changing the look a little. Proposal: `docs/MAP.md`;
waiting on the owner's choices in its §4. The UI redesign follows the map.

## 2026-10-27 — map approved, greybox built

- The owner approved all four points of `docs/MAP.md`, and set the UI direction (`docs/UI.md`):
  the simplest possible screen; every upgrade and interaction is done on the objects in the world.
  The detailed UI design waits; the owner asked to build the map first.
- `src/shared/Layout.luau` (+ `Config.Map`, `tests/spec/layout.luau`): every position of the valley.
- `tools/map/build_terrain.luau` and `tools/map/build_greybox.luau`: run through Studio's MCP in a
  work place (`assets/raw/MapWork.rbxlx`, a copy of the built place, gitignored), they build the
  terrain (floor, hills, the four quarters, streams, lava rills, ring road, paths, ponds) and a
  greybox (hedged plots with every area blocked out, the Market stalls, the Heart, goo springs,
  trees, lighting). Pictures: `docs/map-greybox/`.
- Open: the map is built in a work place only. The plan is to move both builders into the game
  (a server `World` module that builds the valley from `Layout` at start), so the real place needs
  no hand-saved terrain. Lava in the Ember rills is hidden under the basalt (fix in the art pass).

## 2026-10-27 — concept art before 3D (owner)

The owner asked not to build 3D yet: first ChatGPT concept art of the home plot, "the best
possible visuals, but a simple and clean design". Prompts: `docs/art/chatgpt-home-plot.md`
(style lock + the whole plot + each area at levels 1/4/7/10), with the owner's reference art
copied to `art/chatgpt-refs/`. All 9 pictures were generated (2026-10-27) in the owner's ChatGPT chat
"Image placement suggestion" (prompts sent from the browser pane; the reference pictures were pasted
through the ChatGPT desktop app, as the pane cannot attach files). Picture 1 approved and saved as
`art/inbox/1-plot.png`; 2-9 wait for the owner to download them (the pane cannot download).
The owner saved 2-9 in the project root; they are now `art/concept/2-fishing.png` .. `9-home.png`
(picture 1 was not among them).

First 3D trial (owner's request): the level-1 breeding house from `art/concept/7-breeding-L1.png`.
Three tries in the MapWork place: `generate_procedural_model` from the picture failed (red error box);
two `generate_mesh` text prompts written from the picture both came out cute; the second (scalloped
pink roof, heart on top, beams, stone base, arched door, round window) is placed in Plot 5's breeding
spot. Side by side: `docs/map-greybox/compare-breeding-L1.png`. Close in shape and colours; missing
the dressing around it (bushes, flower pots, stepping stones), the heart emblem over the door, the
warm window, and a real slime model; the roof is a little lilac.

## 2026-10-27 — plot areas, built directly in Studio (owner's restart)

- Level-1 fishing pond (`docs/areas/fishing.md`, approved) and level-1 vegetable garden built in Plot 5 of the
  work place by `tools/map/build_fishing_l1.luau`, `build_garden_l1.luau`; dressed with the free Creator Store
  "Nature stylized Pack" by `dress_plot_nature.luau`; lit by `lighting_storybook.luau` (research in
  `.claude/skills/studio-build/RESEARCH.md`, "Stylized cozy look"). Pictures `docs/areas/*-v3.jpg`.
- Builders place from `Config.Map.GroundY` (terrain surface at y = 2).
- Research "Do this first" items not yet applied: stylized grass MaterialVariant, darker rims, cartoon water,
  shadow discs, reed sway, outlines on hero props, CC0 packs (KayKit, Quaternius crops, Kenney).

## 2026-10-27 — the plot as a small village (owner)

- All six areas of Plot 5 (pond, pantry, garden, kitchen, breeding pen, training ground) now face
  the plot's middle (`Layout.plotAreaFacing`, tested). `tools/map/build_village.luau` adds the stone
  plaza with a well, lamps and planters, paved paths to each area and the gate, a tall wooden fence
  round the plot with a towered gate and name board, and kit trees, bushes and flowers; it clears the
  greybox hedge, meadow house and hatchery nest. Pictures `docs/areas/village-*.jpg`.
- The pond now holds real terrain water (owner's request; `pond_water_l1.luau`), the painted flat
  water is gone. The boulder "SteppingStones" models were removed from the pond and garden entrances
  (owner: badly placed); the garden has a straight line of flat stepping stones instead.
- Pond, second pass (owner): terrain water fills whole 4-stud voxels, so its surface sits near y = 0,
  two studs under the floor; the bank now steps down to it in two sand steps (`stud_floor.luau`), so no
  grass shows. Water as clear as it goes (`WaterTransparency` 1). Lilies sit on the surface. Five fish
  (koi and little blue fish, `generate_mesh`, kept in the work place's `ServerStorage.FishKit`) swim
  loose loops just under the surface, moved on the client by `src/client/PondFish.client.luau` (tag
  "PondFish"); seen working in a Studio play test. Deeper than about 1 stud the water's tint hides them.
  Pictures `docs/areas/fishing-real-water.jpg`, `fishing-fish.jpg`.
- Campfire, third pass (owner): in the empty front-right cell, a round earth stud floor with a stone
  ring, a log teepee and real-looking fire, six small seats (the owner's log benches and kit stumps,
  turned to the fire), lantern posts and tall trees behind; a path from the plaza. Picture
  `docs/areas/campfire.jpg`. The owner's models are in the work place's `ServerStorage.OwnerKit`
  (inserted from the Mue_you inventory with MCP `insert_asset`, scripts removed).
- Fire "like real" for the campfire and the kitchen stove (one recipe, `addFire` in both builders):
  the glow, embers and heat of the "Realistic Fire VFX" pack in the owner's inventory
  (`OwnerKit.CampFlame`, scaled, bloom calmed, tongues kept low), two layers of licking flames with
  Roblox's flame texture, and a light that flickers (`src/client/FireFlicker.client.luau`, tag
  "Flicker"). The stove's chimney smokes a little. Pictures `campfire.jpg`, `kitchen-fire.jpg`.
- Trees: every code-built tree (the greybox's trunk-and-ball trees on the valley rim and in the Wild
  Garden, 140) swapped for the owner's own tree models by `replace_greybox_trees.luau`;
  `build_greybox.luau` places the same on a rebuild. The ring of big trees inside the plot fence is
  the owner's trees too, 22-28 studs tall. Nothing in a home plot sways (owner).
- Taken out (owner): the eggs in the nest and the incubator, the two round grain sacks at the
  pantry, the round seed sack in the garden.
- Crops in growth stages (owner: they grow like a real process, seedling to harvest): Carrot1..4 and
  Cabbage1..4 (seedling, young, growing, ripe; `generate_mesh`, in the work place's
  `ServerStorage.CropKit`; the carrot root is buried, only its shoulder shows). Each plant in a bed is
  a model tagged "Crop" with attributes Crop and Stage; the beds now show the stages side by side.
  Picture `garden-crop-stages.jpg`.
- For later (Phase 2), as the owner asked: the growing system sets a plant's Stage over time and
  swaps in the next stage's model, scaling it up smoothly from the last; the training ground's dummy,
  target and rack get motion when a slime trains there.
- Props remade low poly (owner: "as beautiful and detailed as the crops, everything"): 21 models from
  `generate_mesh` in the work place's `ServerStorage.PropKit` — Stove, KitchenCounter, FirewoodPile,
  StorageShed, CrateStack, WoodBarrel, Cottage, Incubator, BirdNest, WaterTrough, HayBale,
  FlowerPot, TrainingDummy, ArcheryTarget, WeaponRack, BannerFlag, FishBucket, WateringCan,
  StoneWell, Planter, VillageLamp. `tools/map/replace_props.luau` (after build_village) swaps each
  part-built prop group for its kit model, fitted to the group's place and height and facing the
  area's front; the work-spot, nest and incubator markers stay as invisible parts, lamps keep their
  light. generate_mesh hands meshes back turned by a random angle: each kit mesh is set square when
  it goes into the kit. Floors, paths, fences and the area signs stay in the stud look. Pictures
  `docs/areas/props-*.jpg`, `prop-kit.jpg`.
- `tools/map/sync_client.luau` copies the client scripts into the work place for play tests.
- `tools/map/sync_shared.luau` copies the repo's Config and Layout into the work place (it swaps in
  fresh ModuleScripts, since Studio caches what require returned).
- Build order in Studio: build_fishing_l1, build_garden_l1, dress_plot_nature, polish_plot,
  build_kitchen_l1, build_pantry_l1, build_breeding_l1, build_training_l1, build_village, stud_floor,
  pond_water_l1.
- The work place must be saved in Studio (Ctrl+S) to keep the build.

Next (after the map and UI are agreed)
- Phase 2, The farm: the 3D plot and the slimes on it, the nest house, eggs and the reveal, the
  breeding house, the collection book, selling. Needs the first 3D models (slime body, nest house)
  made from the owner's paintings, and remotes for Breed / Hatch / Sell.
- First Studio play test of the profile layer (in-memory store in an unpublished place).

Notes
- The MakePlay builder also wrote a `ROBLOX_EXPORT.md` in the original project on request, but the
  file is not served by the game host; it was rebuilt from its own notes (it has no access to the
  old chat), so the owner-history docs here are the better source.
- Sounds in `assets/lib/bvker-foley/` of the original come from a third-party library: check its
  licence before uploading them to Roblox.
