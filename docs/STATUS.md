## 2026-10-27 — project started

Done
- The original web game (makeplay.ai, "Goo Lineage V2") was read in full: its JS source, its
  `AGENTS.md`, 600+ art, sound and animation files (`reference/goo-lineage-web/`, gitignored),
  and all 514 messages the owner sent its AI builder.
- Reference specs written: `docs/reference/01`–`05` (farm, battle, UI and world, effects, the
  owner's history of requests and vetoes).
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: what the Roblox version keeps and changes, and the build order.
- Project skeleton: Rojo tree, Lune tests, StyLua, Selene, `tools/check.ps1` (CHECK OK).

Waiting on the owner
- The look (`docs/DESIGN.md` §3): painted 2.5D with their original art (recommended), full 3D, or
  mixed.

Next
- Phase 1, Foundation: the shared rules (genetics, breeding, eggs) in Luau with tests, and the
  player profile with safe saving. Does not depend on the look.

Notes
- The MakePlay builder also wrote a `ROBLOX_EXPORT.md` in the original project on request, but the
  file is not served by the game host; it was rebuilt from its own notes (it has no access to the
  old chat), so the owner-history docs here are the better source.
- Sounds in `assets/lib/bvker-foley/` of the original come from a third-party library: check its
  licence before uploading them to Roblox.
